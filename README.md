# dotfiles

These is my bunch of configurations for my OSX commandline, including
vim, git, zsh, tmux.

Execute the Makefile ``make all`` and it will create symlinks to your
home directory.

Get ensure you delete all you real files and directories before trying.

This is a replacement for former separate repositories and works well
with boxen.
